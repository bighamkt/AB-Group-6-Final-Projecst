        (https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). Our target audience is movie lovers who is trying to find good movies based on his or her interests. Some specific questions our audience will

        based on genre since one movie could have many genres, as well as trimming down some of the unnecessary variables since we won’t be using all 28 available in the original dataset. We plan on using the 
        libraries we’ve used up until now such as dplyr and plotly. We don’t currently plan on using any new libraries but we will research them as we run into issues that require additional capabilities. We’ll 
        be using some basic statistical analysis but don’t anticipate needing to use anything beyond the basics or machine learning. The biggest challenge we foresee is maintaining a vision for this project in 
        the face of such a large dataset. Since we have so many variables available to investigate we will need to maintain strong communication to make sure that everyone is on the same page about which questions 
        we are focusing on.")
